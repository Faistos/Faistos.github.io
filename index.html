      -ussy as a suffix is not gender-specific. On top of that, bussy is already a form of -ussy, for the word boy. Boyussy does not work, 
	  due to y acting more like a vowel in context of the word as a whole. Using bussy in place of -ussy is never applicable. 
	  To use bussy means you are using Bussy as a descriptor, not as a noun (ex: dolphin bussy instead of dolphussy.) This is true for all words, 
	  even when spelling and/or pronunciation is not immediately obvious. (Ex: Ohio, while one thing might need to use Ohiobussy or Ohbussy, 
	  is spelled Ohussy, pronounced Oh-hussy. Some could argue for Ohiussy, pronounced Ohi-ussy, but that results in -ussy still being separate from the word, 
	  not integrated.)

		It's literally just cola you piece of shit. There's no cough syrup or anything. What the fuck is wrong with you. 
		How fucking desperate are you to seem cool that you decide you want to force a "joke" about a child consuming drugs. 
		Which would be funny except nothing in this scene implies that they're doing drugs or a drug stand-in. 
		You just saw a can of soda and the two neurons in your head fired for the first time in a week, and you jumped into the 
		comments to screech lEAn and spam purple emojis like a clown bastard. You people are the reason art is dying. Fuck you.
